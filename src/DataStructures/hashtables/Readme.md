# HashTable

* Hash tables are a Collection of Key Value Pairs.
* Hash tables can find values quickly given a key.
* Hash tables can add new key-values quickly.
* Hash tables store data in a large array, and work by hashing the keys.
* A good hash should be fast, distribute keys uniformly, and be deterministic.
* Seperate chaining and linear probing are two strategies used to deal with two keys that 
hash to the same index.
* searching, updating, deleting take O(1)
* searching by values are going to take O(N)
